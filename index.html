		<p> Christmas time is very special for everyone, what makes it even more special is the family gatherings that happen to the most people at least once or twice a year. This holiday is not only for gift-exchanging, but most importantly for paying back to those who have sacrificed their love and hard-work to raise and help everyone within the family. As well as to uplift and help each other in most-any possible way. What makes this reunion possible is this holiday that happens only once a year. <br><br> During the process we remember what makes the caring and sharing special, and what our loved ones have given to us that makes us who we are today. Especially when we reminisce, we reminisce stories that we have never heard before, and everything else we share and build during this holiday season becomes a history to reminisce for the following year. Most importantly showing and giving our love and support to those that we appreciate the most;

<span class="boldtext italictext">Family

</span> 

It's the 

<span class=‚Äùboldtext‚Äù>best 

</span> 

you can possibly wish!

	<h2 style="font-size:40px;"> Family what makes the holiday so special once again</h2>

		<p> Christmas has been celebrated by millions of people around the globe. Some celebrate it with their families, and some celebrate without their family members. Some family-gatherings are a lot smaller than other gatherings. However, still it all depends on the families and how they choose to celebrate this once-a-year time holiday. However, in the end it still depends on the family that makes the holiday fun and exciting to celebrate. Without family, the holiday wouldn't feel like a holiday because there wouldn't be much to celebrate and share. The purpose of it being special is the creativity and productivity that occurs within the family. The magic and the making within the family is so much depended on the personalities and the different ideas that families bring together and share with one another on this great Christmas Time.</p>
